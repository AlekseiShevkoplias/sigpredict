# sigpredict
This was a part of our project on SMTB2019.
We've trained some Convolutional Neural Networks to 
predict if the given DNA sequence is situated on
the closed or the open chromatin.
Open expression.ipynb to test the trained neural nets.
If you want to know how they were trained, open 
the folder NeuralNetworks. But the data isn't there. 

This project hopefully is to be continued...
